<h2>Statistics</h2>

Over 250 million people suffer from Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). These can be classified in some broader categories:

* Cancer
* Cardiovascular Diseases
* Chronic Respiratory Diseases
* Mental Illness
* Diabetes 

For the initial phase, Revive will be focused on cancer, which is actually the second biggest killer among NCDs, just after Cardiovascular Diseases. However, it is the most preventable NCD, and with early detection, most types of cancers can be properly treated. This gives the potential to save a lot of lives, especially in the areas where detection is not currently available, such as in the urban slums.


Revive has a clear and ambitious target: to reach 25 million people currently living in the slums, providing affordable detection tools and offering support and treatment to people with NCDs. Below is a graph regarding the expansion plans of Revive: by reaching more and more slums around the world, we can reach our objectives.
